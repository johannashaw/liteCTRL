What is a php session?

When you work with an application, you open it, do some changes, and then you close it. 
This is much like a Session. The computer knows who you are. It knows when you start the application 
and when you end. But on the internet there is one problem: the web server does not know who you are 
or what you do, because the HTTP address doesn't maintain state.

Session variables solve this problem by storing user information to be used across 
multiple pages (e.g. username, favorite color, etc). By default, session variables last until 
the user closes the browser.

So; Session variables hold information about one single user, and are 
available to all pages in one application.
